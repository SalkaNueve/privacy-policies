Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how the App handles your information.</p> <h2>Data Collection</h2> <p>Wavely does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All information you enter in the App — including contraction records, due date, baby's name, and preferences — is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.</p> <p>We do not use analytics, tracking, cookies, or any third-party data collection tools.</p> <h2>What Data Is Stored Locally</h2> <p>The following data is stored on your device and never leaves it:</p> <ul> <li>Contraction records (timestamps, duration, intensity)</li> <li>Personal profile information (due date, baby's name, baby's gender)</li> <li>App preferences (language, appearance, premium status)</li> </ul> <h2>Third-Party Services</h2> <p>Wavely uses Apple's StoreKit framework to process in-app purchases. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. We do not have access to your payment information.</p> <p>In future updates, the free version of the App may include advertisements served through third-party ad networks. If implemented, this privacy policy will be updated to reflect the types of data collected by those services.</p> <h2>Home Screen Widget</h2> <p>The Wavely widget displays contraction data on your home screen. This data is shared between the App and the widget using a local App Group container on your device. No data is transmitted externally.</p> <h2>PDF Export</h2> <p>The PDF export feature generates a document on your device containing your contraction history. The file is shared using the iOS share sheet. We do not receive or store a copy of this document.</p> <h2>Children's Privacy</h2> <p>Wavely is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p> <h2>Data Deletion</h2> <p>You can delete all your data at any time through the App by going to Settings → Clear all contractions. You can also delete the App from your device, which removes all locally stored data.</p> <h2>Your Rights</h2> <p>Since Wavely does not collect or process personal data on external servers, there is no personal data held by us to access, modify, or delete. All your data is under your control on your device.</p> <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2> <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date below. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p> <h2>Contact</h2> <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at:<br> <a href="mailto:YOUR_EMAIL_HERE">YOUR_EMAIL_HERE</a></p> <p class="updated">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p> </div> </body> </html>
